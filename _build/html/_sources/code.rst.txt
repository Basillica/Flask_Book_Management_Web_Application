Project Summary
===============


To use the application, a User will only need to register and login.
The rest is very straightforward, and user friendly.

To send emails to all registered emails by searching through all the ISBN in the
database, the 'Mail All ISBN' button from the dashboard is used. This would
also required further security and access.
To mail Users based only on a list of selected ISBNs, the 'Mail select ISBN'
button is used. This will redirect to a new page where the list of desired
ISBNs can be provided.

The 'Add a Book' button does what it says, just like the 'Search Books' button.
To search a book from a User's dashboard, the user can use The Book Name,
the name of the Author or the ISBN of a book. To search using the name of a book
or the name of an Author, the user could also use a SUBSTRING of these.

The JSON-API is also available from www.site.com/books for example.
This Json-api can also be sorted, depending on the desired result.
